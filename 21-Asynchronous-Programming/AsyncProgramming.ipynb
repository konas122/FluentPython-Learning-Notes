    "All network I/O is done with coroutines in `asyncio`, but not file I/O. However, file I/O is also \"blocking\"——in the sense that reading/writing files takes thousands of times longer than reading/writing to RAM. If you're using Network-Attached Storage, it may even involve network I/O under te covers. \n",
